# 2ZeC: Two-sided Zeno's Crop

An algorithmic proposal for cropping impulse respose data in an automatic fashion. Said impulse responses may typically be the result of (non)linear system identification procedures. It is common to prune the tails of the obtained response by hand, a process which requires time and human knowledge. 2ZeC proposes a simple iterative solution based on spectral error within the bandwidth of interest.
